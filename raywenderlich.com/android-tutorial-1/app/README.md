### Kotlin Android App Development Tutorial 1
---
__UI Design Intro:__ The fist thing after creating the Hello World project, is to design or edit the UI. 

For this, we need to navigate to this folder:
```
app\res\layout\
``` 
and open this file: `activity_main.xml` and inside the text version, we see under `TextView` tag, there is a section saying:
```
android:text="Hello World!"
```
We can change the title Written in the middle of app to anything we want.

Next, we can get back to `design` view, and design the UI visually by drag/drop `controls` to the screen.

For example, labels in Java are called `TextView`.

__Positioning:__ When we put controls on the screen, we can add `Rules` to them. The 4 circles around the item container, are where we can define the rules. 

The default label that came with the app and said `Hello World` had the rules, and we saw them as spring looking shapes.
